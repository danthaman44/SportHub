Setup:

Server - Our server is running on windows azure apache servers provided by Duke University. We're running django backed by postgresql.

The server code is in the directories: mysite, db_beers, and static.
We are using http to send data between the app and server.

Setting up django can be involved. If you are new to django and want to boot this server up on your own, check out a django tutorial.
