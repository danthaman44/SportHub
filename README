SportHub: The IOS App for organizing pick-up sports.
Created by Dan Deng and Sean Miller

Unfortunately we only have an enterprise license so this app is not available on the Apple App Store.


Setup:

Server - Our server is running on Windows Azure Apache servers provided by Duke University. We're running django backed by postgresql.

The server code is in the directories: mysite, db_beers, and static.
We are using http to send data between the app and server.

Setting up django can be involved. If you are new to django and want to boot this server up on your own, check out a django tutorial.

App - The iOS code is objective-C written in XCode. It is compatable with iOS 7, 6 and 5.
